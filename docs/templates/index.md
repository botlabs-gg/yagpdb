This is the documentation for YAGPDB.

It is currently very incomplete and very work in progress, so if you want to help out writing docs please don't hesitate to do so.

If you don't find the information you're looking for then i recommend you to join the support server above.

## Reporting Issues

If you're having issues with the bot, for example a command returning something like "Failed ..." then you might have come across a bug, the discord API may be having problems, or the 3rd party service that command queries (if any) is having problems, in any case you should join the support server (located in the top bar) and let me know about this.

Alternatively you can also open a issue on the [github page for the bot](https://github.com/jonas747/yagpdb) 

## Feature suggestions

If you have a suggestion for a new feature or improvements for an existing one, you can either send a message in the support server or open a issue in the [github repo](https://github.com/jonas747/yagpdb) for the bot, the latter one is preferred since i tend to forget things.
