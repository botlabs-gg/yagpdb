This page will help you quickly set up the bot.

Setup:

1. Go to https://yagpdb.xyz/ 
2. On the upper-right-corner, click on "Login Using Discord"
3. Simply login using your Discord credentials, but don't worry, you're on Discord's website now, we do not get any of your credentials, you'll be redirected once you've authorized YAGPDB to view the servers you're on.
4. Authorize YAGPDB.xyz to connect to your account.
5. On the upper-right-corner, under "select a server", simply select the server you want the bot on. Note: You can only add the bot if you have manage server permissions.

[There is also a video tutorial made by KingCobra#8803 which covers most of the features, here!](https://youtu.be/zG8PekpD-kk)

You can now configure whatever you want. Click through the various pages and explore a little to see what the bot offers.

If you run into any issues, join the support server above, although please do try to figure out stuff out yourself a little bit, as my time, and the support team's time, is limited, no one is getting paid for this (if anything I'm losing money on hosting and working on this). So don't get mad if you don't get a fast response or we tell you to read the docs first (if you're being rude in the support server, chances are you're gonna get banned).
