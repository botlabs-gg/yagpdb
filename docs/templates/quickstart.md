This page will help you quickly set up the bot.

Setup:

1. Go to https://yagpdb.xyz/ 
2. On the upper-right-corner, click on "Login Using Discord"
3. Simply login using your discord credentials, but don't worry, you're on discord's website now, we do not get any of your credentials, you'll be redirected once you've authorized YAGPDB to view the servers you're on.
4. Authorize YAGPDB.xyz to connect to your account.
5. On the upper-right-corner, under "select a server", simply select the server you want the bot on. Note: You can only add the bot if you have manage server permissions.

You can now configure whatever you want, click through the various pages and explore a little to see what it offers.

If you run into any issues join the support server above, although please do try to figure out stuff out yourself a little bit as my time is limited.
