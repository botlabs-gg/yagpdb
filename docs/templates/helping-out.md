YAGPDB is being made and ran by 1 guy atm, me myself and i. So any help i can get is appreciated.

There is several ways you can help making YAGPDB better, you don't have to know any coding to help!

 - Writing documentation. The bot needs Documentation! See further below for more info on writing documentation.
 - Writing code.
 - Helping out other people in discord.
 - Fix whatever typos and grammar error you find (there are many of them)
 - Buy the ad space

### Writing this Documentation

YAGPDB is definitely one of the more complicated bots out there, and the reason as stated before for that is i prefer combustibility and security over looks, therefor a lot of documentation is needed for people to fully utilize and understand the features the bot provides.

Check the guide below if you're interested and if you have any questions then ask me on discord.

#### Simple guide on making a change to a documentation page

 1. Fork YAGPDB
    - Create/Login to github
    - Navigate to the project page [here](https://github.com/jonas747/yagpdb)
    - Press the fork button
 2. You should be able to see something like this then ![Fork Project Name Image]({{static "doc-guide-1-fork.png"}})
 3. Create a new branch from the dev branch
    - Press the branch button here ![Branch button image]({{static "doc-guide-2-branch-button.png"}})
    - Click the dev branch
    - Once you're on the dev branch, click the branch button again and type in a name you wanna give your branch
    - ![Create branch image]({{static "doc-guide-3-branch-create.png"}})
 4. After that you should be on your new branch, the branch button should now say `Branch: your branch name here`
 5. Make the changes
    - If you wanna make a change to plugin-specific help, you can find that in `plugin-name/assets/help-page.md`
    - If you wanna make a change to general help, you can do that in `docs/templates/xxxx.md`
    - Open the file on github, and press the edit button 
    - ![doc-guide-4-edit-button.png]({{static "doc-guide-4-edit-button.png"}})
    - Make your changes, and write a commit message, describing what you did 
    - ![doc-guide-5-commit-message.png]({{static "doc-guide-5-commit-message.png"}})
    - Press the commit button
 6. Make the pull request
    - Go back to the root folder (go out of all the directories)
    - Something should appear, with a button next to it saying "Compare and pull request"
    - ![doc-guide-6-changes.png]({{static "doc-guide-6-changes.png"}})
    - Set base branch to Dev
    - ![doc-guide-7-base-branch.png]({{static "doc-guide-7-base-branch.png"}})
    - Describe what you did and press Create pull request
 7. Wait for response from me, you might get some comments back with proposed changes, make those and hopefully it will be merged!


### Contributing code

The bot is written in go, and the web interface is using plain HTML with bootstrap and some small javascript here and there. If you want to make a contribution like fix a bug, add a feature and so on you should probably notify me first by making a issue or sending me a message on discord so that you don't waste your time in case i was also working on that.
