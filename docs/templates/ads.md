I rent out the lower left corner to help pay for the cost of running yagpdb. If you want to rent that spot, then feel free to contact me, either on email (jonasr747@gmail.com) or on Discord (Jonas747#0001).

Here's some details on that spot:
 - The control panel pages gets around 10k page views per week
 - The current price is fixed at 1$/day, I do not have any system for ad stats, such as click throughs, in place yet, so it's a constant for now.
 - The size is 250x225
     + The reason it's small is because it's always visible (it's statically positioned).
 - I only allow a static image or a not-very-annoying video(muted)/gif
     + I do not allow i-frames or anything like that.
