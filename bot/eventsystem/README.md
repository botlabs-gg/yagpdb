# YAGPDBs event system

Instead of just using discordgo's standard simple event system, i like to experiment a little as i work on stuff to see what happens

It all boils down to a simple 3d slice of handlers (handlers [][][]Handler)

The first index is the event index, that length  is generated by events_gen.go

Next index is order, there is 3 orders:

0 - first ran
1 - state handler is here
2 - last, ran concurrently from here on

orders 1 and 0 is ran syncrhounsly, but 2 is ran concurrently, this is to have the state be as proper as possible.
