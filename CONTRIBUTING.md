# Contributing Guidelines

Please read these guidelines carefully before opening a pull request, as they contain important information on how we
process pull requests.

## Suggesting New Features

If you'd like to propose a new feature, but aren't comfortable with programming in Go, please join the
[support server](https://discord.gg/4udtcA5) and view the instructions in the `#suggestions` channel.

Before creating a new suggestion, make sure it hasn't already been suggested or pull requested.
Also check closed pull requests for that matter.

## Opening Pull Requests

For opening pull requests, the following steps apply:

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Make your changes on a new branch stemming from `master` 
	 ```shell
	 $ git switch -c my-branch master
	 ```
4. Commit your changes
5. Open a pull request **against the `dev` branch**.

Your commit messages and/or PR titles should be descriptive. Something like "Update README" isn't exactly helpful.
Please provide a small description of your patch as well, even if it's a rather trivial change.
