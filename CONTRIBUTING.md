Are you planning on contributing or suggesting something for the bot? Go ahead, just make sure you know what you are doing, we don't wanna mess with trying to fix the bot if someone breaks it!

In order to make a suggestion, head to the [issues page](https://github.com/jonas747/yagpdb/issues) and make an issue titled "Suggestion: (name)" and fill out a little description. Please please please, check that this hasn't already been suggested or requested as a PR.

If you want to make a contribution, create a fork, then push the changes you make to the dev branch (Jonas747/yagpdb/dev). This is key for larger commits and edits to important / complicated parts of the bot so it can be tested safely without breaking everything.
