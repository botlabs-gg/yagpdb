	/*
		Returns the argument definitions

		if 'combos' is non nil, then that takes priority over 'required'
		Combos wllows the command to take different combinations and orders of arguments

		Example: a `clean` command that deletes x amount of messages and can optionally filter by user
		could look like this
		```
		argDefs = []*ArgDef{
		    {Name: "limit", Type: Int, Default: 10},
		    {Name: "user", Type: User, RequireMention: true},
		}
		requiredArgs = 0
		```
		Here the clean command can take any number of arguments, if no arguments are passed, limit will be 10, and user will be nil.
		if only a limit is provided, then user will be nil and
		Here we have the 2 arguments, and atm we can only invoke this as `clean x` or `clean x @user`
		using combos we can also allow any order here, this is possible because the user arg cannot be a number.
		so if we use the combos:
		```
		combos = [][]int{
			[]int{0},   // Allow only a limit to be passed
			[]int{0,1}, // Allow both a limit and user to be passed, in that order
			[]int{1},   // Allow only a user to be passed, then limit will have its default value of 10
			[]int{1,0}, // Allow both a user and limit to be passed, in that order
			[]int{},    // Allow no arguments to be passe, limit will then have its default of 10, and user will be nil
		}
		```
		As you can see, the integers are indexes in the argument definitions returned. The above combos will allow any combination or arguments, even none.

		Important: Argument combos can only allow multiple orders or arguments with different types. It cannot for example detect the difference between 2 text arguments passed.
		Here's some notes on different types and how well they differentiate:

		user to number:
			user to number can always be differentiated between, unless a username is provided instead of a mention,
			if a username consists of only numbers then it would think that that user is a number, if you use this you need to set the
			RequireMention flag.

		user to string:
			this is also pretty reliable, but the RequireMention flag is pretty much required here.

		string to number:
			this can work if you know the string will never itself be a number.

		Note: you can force arguments to become strings by putting them in quotes or code blocks.

/*
CmdWithSwitches commands can define a set of switches, which might be a cleaner alternative to combos
This will also set the context value of ContextStrippedSwitches to the arg string without the switches, for further parsing of the remaining switch-less args

if you don't know what a switch is, clean command example using both a switch and single argdef could look like the following:
`clean 10`          - clean 10 last messages without a user specified
`clean -u @user 10` - specify a user, but still clean 10 messages

This is a lot cleaner than using argument combos
