YAGPDB 0.30 is here, likely the last version before i move this out of alpha, therefore i have prepared a [survey to get some nice feedback, and possibly great memes as well (click here)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbuEUkWvyr7Jb-7EIoP_1Z8DKSjFReZk2l5SdPBrNwr7ME0Q/viewform?usp=sf_link=)

0.29 went all the way up to 0.29.10! There was a lot of bugs in it, i definitively didn't test it well enough.

This update is mostly bugfixes, and some new and improved custom command functionality.

Anyways here's the changelog:

- New custom command function **execAdmin**
  - same as exec but executes the command as if the bot was the one using it, meaning full permissions.
- `exec` and `execAdmin` now accepts user arguments
  - This means you can have a custom command like this, which would mute the person triggering the command:
    - `{{execAdmin "mute" .User 1 "You were muted by an evil custom command!"}}`
- New custom command function **userArg**
  - Returns a user object from either id or mention string, can be used in exec or execAdmin.
  - Example, make the person invoking the command rep a user by id:
    - `{{exec "giverep" (userArg 232658301714825217)}}`
  - Or accept a user arg in the custom command:
    - `{{exec "giverep" (userArg (index .CmdArgs 0))}}`
    - Invoke it like this: `-repalias @user` (repalias is the trigger in this example)
- Moderation Mute remove roles: Fixed roles not being given back to the user when muting an already muted user
- Moderation Mute remove roles: Fix roles removed after the mute command not being given back when unmuted.

**This is most likely the last version (except bugfixes) before going out of alpha!**

This means:

- Major control panel overhaul, better mobile support, dark mode, and a lot of usability improvements overall.
- A new bot icon, and yes, i know A LOT of you guys have nicknamed it `spongebot` or stuff like that, im sorry :( (reason for this is because i've been wanting to change it for a while, and one of my patrons came up with a concept i really like)
- Much better documentation that is easy to contribute to

So yeah, stay tuned!
