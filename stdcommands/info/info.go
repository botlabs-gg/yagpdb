This bot focuses on being configurable and therefore is one of the more advanced bots.
It can perform a range of general purpose functionality (Reddit feeds, various commands, moderation utilities, automoderator functionality and so on) and it's configured through a web control panel.
I'm currently being run and developed by Jonas747#0001 (105487308693757952) but the bot is open source (<https://github.com/jonas747/yagpdb>), so if you know Go and want to make some contributions, feel free to make a PR.
