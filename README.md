cards against discord

A discord bot for cards against humanity, and unlike other cah bots, you dont type your shit, you use the power of reactions to pick your shizz, MAGIC.

Pretty functional, some bugs may be around.

To compile and run the standalone bot: (assuming you have go and git installed)

```
go get github.com/jonas747/cardsagainstdiscord/cmd/cardsagainstdiscord
cd $GOPATH/bin
# The executable now lies here, set DG_TOKEN to your token prefixed with "Bot " and run it
```
